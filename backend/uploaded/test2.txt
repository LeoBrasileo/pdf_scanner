Again,

28 Throughout the creation of the Joint Works, to which Eskupe contributed substantial
Jand valuable contributions to, Eskupe and Phora failed to execute @ writen agreement, It was
[understood by Eskupe and Phora that they were joint authors in the Joint Works and they intended to
own the Joint Works jointly and equally.

29, Ato time has Eskupe authorized anyone to execute any agreement on his behalf that
determined or altered any of the ownership, rights, and interests in and/or to the Joint Works

B. Certificates of Employment

30. In or around 2017, Wamer communicated with Phora and requested Eskupe’s fees
fand royalty rates on Wamer’s project “Run To.” Phora then intentionally, incorrectly, and
fraudulently informed Warmer that Eskupe’s “fees and royalty ates are both at 0.” Without verifying
this information with Eskupe, Wamer emailed Phora a Certificate of Employment agreement, dated
March 16, 2017, and requested that Phora obtain Eskupe’s signature and return the signed certificate
to Warner “as soon as possible to send music out ASAP.” By and through its words and conduet,
Warner authorized Phora to act as its agent.

31. Following Wamer’s request, Phora intentionally misrepresented to Jesus Rivera

ivera”), Phora’s assistant and agentrepresentative at the time, that Eskupe’s signature was

required by Wamer for a hasie “music video clearance” so that Phora and Warner had permission to

Jereate a music video for the single “Run To

“Phora's Representation”), Phora failed to inform
Rivera that Phora and/or Warner intended to usurp all of Eskupe's ownership, rights, and interests to
Run To.

32. Phora tasked Rivera to acquire Eskupe’s signature. As instructed by Phora, Rivera
asked Eskupe for his signature and relayed Phora’s Representation to explain why it was needed.

38. Having been explained to and believing that his signature would be utilized for the
specific and limited purpose outlined in Phora's Representation, Eskupe texted his signature (the

6
COMPLAINT

Signature”) into a group chat, The group chat was comprised of Rivera, Phora, Anthony Ruiz pk.
Anthro Beals, and Phora’sgirlitiend atthe time, Destiny Blakley the “Group Chat"). In reliance on
Phora's Representation, Eskupe's Signature was provided fora very limited purpose

34, Rather than forthe intended purpose for which the Signature was provided, it was
later discovered that the Signature was affixed to ‘wo separate agreements: (1) Certificate of

9, and (2)

Employment No, 1 ~ dated March 16, 2017, (“Certificate No, 1") (See Exhibit
Certificate of Employment ~ dated generally as August 2017 ("Certificate No, 2") (See Exhibit °C”)
(collectively “Cenificates")

35. Upon inspection of the Certificates, Eskupe recognized the Signature on these
documents as the one he provided to the Group Chat pursuant to Phora’s Representation, Phora did
not authorize the use of the Signature for the Certificates.

36. Before detecting the fraudulently signed Certificates, Eskupe never was approached
with the Centficates, he never saw nor reviewed the Certificates, the contents of the Certificates
were never discussed with him or explained to him, nor did Eskupe sign nor authorize anyone to sign
the Centficates as written on his behalf.

37. Upon information and belief, the Certificates were intentionally concealed from
Eskupe for some time to hide their fraudulent nature

i. Certificate No.

38 Certificate No. 1 is an agreement regarding the hit single titled “Run To,” whereby,

according to the certificate, Eskupe was purported to have agreed that rather than jointly owning the

master recording of “Run To,” Eskupe would instead deem this master recording as:

“works ‘made-for hire’...and if not be @ *work-for-hire’ then Producer (Eskupe)
hereby irrevocably grants, transfers, conveys and assigns to Company (Warner) the
entirety of the rights, titles, and interests Producer has or may have...that Company
is and shall be deemed the author andior exclusive owner...throughout the world of
all rights of any kind...” thereby relinquishing his ownership and rights to the master
recording of “Run To,

39 In or around 2017, following Warner’s request that Phora acquire Eskupe’s signature
Jon Certificate No. 1, Phora represented to Rivera that Eskupe’s signature was required for a music
Video clearance for the song titled “Run To.” Phora tasked Rivera to acquire Eskupe’s signature

1
COMPLAINT

based on Phora’s Representation. Eskupe is informed and believes that Rivera didnot read through
JCenitieate No. 1 and lacked awareness of is contents. Instead, Rivera relied solely on Phora's
Representation prior to requesting Eskupe's signature

40. Due to Phora’s Representation, Rivera requested Eskupe’s signature forthe limited
purpose that Phora had deseribed to him. Rivera explained to Eskupe that, as a joint author in the
song “Run To,” bis permission was required before Wamer could film the music video. Based on
Phora's Representation, Rivera further explained that the matter was urgent because Defendants

wanted to film a music video and get it out as soon as possible, Unbeknownst to Rivera at the time,

rather than granting authorization o shoot the music video for “Run To," Certificate No. 1 purported
to tansfer all of Eskupe’s ownership, right, and interests inthe jointly owned work exclusively to
Phora andlor Wamer.

41, In or around March 2017, Eskupe provided his Signature to Rivera via the Group
[Chat fora limited purpose pursuant to Phora's Representation. At this time, Eskupe was unaware of
and didnot authorize his signature forthe broader use of transferring his entire ownership, rights,
and interests inthe work

42, Soon thereafter, upon information and elie, Rivera affixed the Signature to
Ceriticate No, 1 per Phora’s instructions. Eskupe was not provided with Cerificate No. 1 to review
prior to Rivera affixing the Signature to the document

43, The effect of Centificate No. 1, among many things, was to deliver the master
recording of “Run To” unencumbered to “Warner Bros Records ("Record Company”) pursuant
the recording agreement between Antist and Record Company dated November 2, 2016."

44, Cenificate No. 1 purported to grant the transfer of Eskupe’s ownership and rights in
the song “Run To,” in exchange for "good and valuable consideration,” the value of which was not
identified or specified inthe document. Eskupe contends that he did not receive any consideration
with respect to Certificate No. | fiom Phora or Warr. Further, Eskupe is informed and believes
that Defendants are unable to verify the “good and valuable consideration” that was allegedly
provided w Eskupe pursuant the language of Certificate No. 1
w

s
COMPLAINT

i, Certificate No, 2
45. Certificate No. 2 is an agreement regarding the album titled

‘ours Truly Forever,”
\whereby, pursuant to this document, Eskupe was purported to have agreed that ~ rather than jointly

Jowning eleven (11) of the master recordings on the project including, “God,

Way 2 Much,’

‘Sinner Pt. 2,
Jand “When It's Over,” ~ Eskupe would deem these master recordings as “works as ‘made for hire?
for Company (PE).

46, Further, Certificate No. 2 states that “[eJontributor (Eskupe) further acknowledges,
certifies and agrees that Company (PE) is and shall be deemed the author and/or exclusive owner of
all of the foregoing for all purposes and the exclusive owner throughout the world of all the rights
[comprised in the copyright thereof..in perpetuity.” and that “Contributor (Eskupe] did not make any
contributions to the underlying musical composition embodied in the Masters and is not entitled to a
claim in authorship and/or publishing interest stemming therefrom.”

47, These master recordings were to be “delivered by Artist (Phora) to Wamer Bros
Records pursuant to the recording agreement between Artist (Phora) and the Record Company
(Warmer) dated November 2, 20216."

48, Essentially, Certificate No. 2 purported to relinguish Eskupe’s interests, ownership,
and rights in the master recordings on the album “Yours Truly Forever,” to Phora who was to then
deliver them to Warner unencumbered

49. Upon information and belief, between September 2017 and October 2017, Phora's OF

Counsel atthe time, Carron Mitchell and Phora’s agent, Andrew Lieber, were pressuring Phora and
his team to acquire Eskupe's signature for Cetiticate No, 2 at Warner's equest. During this time,
Eskupe and Phora/Phora's team were not communicating.

50, In or around October 14,2017, Phora instructed and pressured Rivera to use Eskupe's
Signature they already possessed and to affix it onto Certificate No. 2. Pursuant to Phora's orders,
Rivera forged, duplicated, copies, and/or replicated and affixed the Signature to Certificate No. 2
Eskupe is informed and believes that Rivera did not read through the conten of Certificate No, 2
prior to utilizing Eskupe's signature as instructed to by Phora.

9
COMPLAINT

5. Prior to Rivera utilizing Eskupe’s signature on Certificate No. 2, Eskupe was not
provided with Certificate No. 2 to review, was completely unaware of its existence or contents, and
did not authorize the use of his signature.

52. Outrageously, Certificate No. 2 purported to grant Phora and Warner, through PE,
sole and exclusive ownership of the master recordings on this album in exchange for “good and
valuable consideration in the amount of $1.00." However, Eskupe contends that he did not receive
Jany consideration with respect to Certificate No, 2. Further, Eskupe is informed and believes that
Defendants are unable to verify that any alleged consideration was provided to Eskupe pursuant the
language of Certificate No, 2.

53. Although Certificate No. 2 was dated generally in August 2017, Eskupe was first
provided with this agreement on April 26, 2023, after a representative of Eskupe demanded all
agreements concerning the album “Yours Truly Forever" from Warner.

Producer Agreement

54. Equally, if not more peculiar, on or about September 14, 2022, Eskupe discovered for
the first time a non-dated Producer Agreement (“Producer Agreement”) allegedly entered into by

Eskupe and Phora. (See Exhibit “

‘The Producer Agreement was first provided to Eskupe's
representative via email through Phora's lawyer atthe time, Matthew Buser, Esq, of Buser Legal

58. Upon inspection of the Producer Agreement, Eskupe immediately observed the
signature that was purported tobe his, was infact not his signature. Upon information and belief, the
signature appearing on the document is a blatant forgery, duplication, andioe replication of Eskupe's
signature.

56, This Producer Agreement stated that “fas of May 2", 2017 Adrian Velasquea agrees
to grant Marco Archer (Phora) all exclusive rights, masters, and royalties forthe songs he produced
mn

[during his time working for Phora." The agreement went on to state this agreement includes “

production and co-production for Phoras albums “With Love,” ‘Sincerely Yours,’ ‘One Life To
Live,’ ‘Angels With Broken Wings,’ “Still A Kid,” and “any other singles he produced for Phora
that were released before May 2%, 2017.” Lastly, the agreement stated, “Phora agrees to be
responsible for the clearing of all samples used on any of these songs.”

10
COMPLAINT

57. Essentially, this document relinguished all of Eskupe's ownership, rights, and
interests to Phora from every single Joint Work that was ereated by Phora and Eskupe

58 Interestingly, this short “agreement” failed to include any reference whatsoever to the
[consideration that was allegedly exchanged for this transfer of rights.

59, Prior to the Producer Agreement’s discovery in 2022, Eskupe was never provided
with the Producer Agreement to review, was completely unaware of its existence or contents, and
did not authorize the use of his signature,

D. Eskupe has Unequivocally Never Assigned his Copyrights, Intellectual Property, or

Royalties to Defendants

60. Eskupe maintains he did not sign, nor did he authorize anyone to sign, the Certificates
andor the Producer Agreement,

61. Upon information and belief, the Signatures on the Certificates were fraudulently
affixed, forged, duplicated, copied, andlor replicated by Phora, acting on behalf of Warner, and/or
his agents/representaives without Eskupe's authorization or consent,

62. Upon information and belief, the signature on the Producer Agreement was
fraudulently affixed, forged, duplicated, and/or replicated by Phora, acting on behalf of Wamer,
andior his agents or representatives without Eskupe's authorization or consent.

63. mall instances, Eskupe’s signature was forged, duplicated, copied, and/or replicated
without Eskupe’s authorization or consent with the intent to deprive Eskupe of the ownership, rights,
and interests feom the Joint Works, without limitation to the compensation derived thereo.

64, Defendants benefited from these fraudulent aets to the detriment of Eskupe.
